    "A data warehouse is a central repository for data from various sources, structured specifically for analytics as opposed to transactions like in a standard online transactional processing database.  A star schema splits a set of data into facts and dimensions, where facts are the measurable, quantitative data, and dimensions are generally expressed as lookup tables that provided descriptive attributes related to a fact.  Star schema's are typically used for data warehouses."

    "- In the database world What is 3NF? Does machine learning use data in 3NF? If so why? \n",
    "\n",
    "        3NF stands for third normal form, which is a subset of 1st and 2nd normal form.  It's characteristics are as follows: 1) no column contains multiple entries in a cell, 2) No columns are dependent on a non-primary key, 3) Non-key columns are dependent on the entire key.  Machine learning at scale would generally benefit from denormalized data rather than data  in 3NF, particularly because 3NF data requires look-ups to various dimension attributes, and this could prove costly/prohibitive in a distributed framework.\n",

    "- In what form does ML consume data?\n",
    "\n",
    "        Generally ML uses data in the form of (label, features), which would be best expressed through denormalized data because it incorporates all fields into a single data strip, even if those fields are redundant according to 2nd and 3rd normal form constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why would one use log files that are denormalized?\n",
    "    \n",
    "        When we denormalize data we're adding redundant information back into a line of data, and this could be very useful in a parallel computation framework because it removes dependencies.  While we may be able to obtain a look-up dimension by using a foreign key in a line of data, this would be bad in hadoop because the value component of the key, value pair would not be sufficient to perform the computation without doing a lookup across the network (or by keeping the extra data in memory)."
